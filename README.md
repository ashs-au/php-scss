# php-scss template
Work with sass/scss and see the results in near realtime! Like a nasty version of Compass!

This is a quick template for working in Bootstrap3 with sass/scss auto-compilation using PHP utilities. Grunt or Compass are classier but this method is very lightweight.

* run composer to install Bootstrap & leafo/scssphp http://leafo.net/scssphp/
* do this according to Panique's instructions https://github.com/panique/php-sass-watcher

Remember to disable browser caching as much as possible when running on localhost via MAMP etc. I'm not claiming that this is original work but it brings the components of the process I've been using on some projects together into one place.

If anyone's interested I can add some wiki content.
